# Ray Tracers

The calculation of seismic travel times is a cornerstone for the migration and stacking approach. Qseek supports different ray tracers for travel time calculation, which can be adapted for different geological settings.

## Constant Velocity

The constant velocity models is trivial and follows:

$$
t_{P} = \frac{d}{v_P}
$$

This module is used for simple use cases and cross-referencing testing.

```python exec='on'
from qseek.utils import generate_docs
from qseek.tracers.constant_velocity import ConstantVelocityTracer

print(generate_docs(ConstantVelocityTracer()))
```

## 1D Layered Velocity Model

Travel times for 1D layered velocity models can be calculated by two different modules.

```python exec='on'
from qseek.utils import generate_docs
from qseek.tracers.fast_marching import FastMarchingTracer

print(generate_docs(FastMarchingTracer()))
```

Calculation of travel times in 1D layered media is based on the [Pyrocko Cake](https://pyrocko.org/docs/current/apps/cake/manual.html#command-line-examples) ray tracer.

print(generate_docs(CakeTracer(), exclude={'earthmodel': {'raw_file_data'}}))
```

## 3D Velocity Model ðŸš€

We implement the fast marching method for calculating first arrivals of waves in 3D volumes. Currently three different 3D velocity models are supported:

* [x] Import [NonLinLoc](http://alomax.free.fr/nlloc/) 3D velocity model
* [x] 1D layered model ðŸ¥ž
* [x] Constant velocity, mainly for testing purposes ðŸ¥¼

Conceptual 2D visualisation for seismic traveltimes calculation in heterogenous media using the fast-marching method for the Eikonal solution is presented. Traveltimes from the receiving station at the surface (indicated by a yellow triangle) towards the subsurface grid are calculated, resulting in station-specifig traveltimes for all potential source locations simultaneously.

```python exec='on'
from qseek.utils import generate_docs
from qseek.insights.tracers.fast_marching_3d import FastMarching3DTracer

print(generate_docs(FastMarching3DTracer()))
```

### Visualizing 3D Models

For quality check, all 3D velocity models are exported to `vtk/` folder as `.vti` files. Use [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/) to inspect and explore the velocity models.
